# My Portfolio

In this exercise, we'll be using our knowledge of **HTML** and **CSS** to build a basic portfolio.

## HTML
Let's get to work. Create a file called `index.html`. That's the file we'll be coding our HTML.

Let's start with the `<head>` section!
- in the `title` tag, put **your name** and the **current date**.

Now to the `<body>`:
- In a `header 1` tag, put **your name**;
- In a `paragraph` tag, briefly write about yourself;
- Now, *right before* the `header 1` containing your name, add **your image** (if you don't have/want to use an image of yourself, just add any image) using the `image` tag;
- After the *paragraph*, use the `header 2` tag and write `About Me` into it. Below it, use either an `unordered list` or an `ordered list` along with the `list item` tags to name things about it. It can be qualities, things you like, or literally whatever you want to put in the list (at least **5** items).

Check the result. You should be able to see your portfolio already on the screen. But it still looks... ugly, right?

## CSS
...So now let's move to our CSS! Start off by creating a file called `main.css`. Or `index.css`. Or `style.css`. Or `banana.css`. It doesn't matter! It's your call how you name it.

> **Hint**: It's a good practice to name files as something meaningful - a name that any developer can read and figure out what it is about. So, as cool as naming your css file `banana.css` sounds, in this case it might create confusion to someone who didn't write it. Every other of the suggested names are valid and good practices for this particular scenario.

Don't forget to **link** the css file you just created in your HTML file, using the `link` tag along with the `rel` and `href` attributes.

Now beautify your portfolio! It's up to you how you want to do it. Here are some suggestions:

> **Hint:** There are always multiple ways to achieve a style with CSS. Below we'll be giving some hints, but by no means it's the only solution. Be creative!

- Centralize the `head 1` and the `image` to the middle of the site. One way to achieve it is to put both inside a `container` and style the container to be `flex`, and then justify the content.
- Change the `font style` and `font size` of our `header 1`. Make it more attractive.
- Make the `paragraph` also more attractive. Some suggestions: Change the font family, font size, put some left and right margins, justify the content, add it to a container with background color etc.
- Also centralize the `head 2`. You might want to use the same `font style` as the `head 1` as well, to keep **consistency**. You can also change the font size of the `head 2`, just make sure it's not bigger than the `head 1` (for semantic purposes).
- Some tips for changing the `list items` would be to remove the bullets with the `list-style`, centralizing it and so on.

Check your portfolio! It should look much better now!


> **Extra:** Feel free to complement your simple portfolio! Play around with the different amounts of html tags and css properties. But remember: **More is better** is not always true when it comes to design! Some of the most beautiful designs are very minimalists.
